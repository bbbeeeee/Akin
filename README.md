The Akin Programming Language
============================

What is it?
------------

The ability to read and write code is the literacy of the future. It's hard to achieve
a higher 'literacy' rate with the extremely foreign (to the general population) image
of programming.

Akin is a programming language that is intended to make learning how to program easier. 
The aim of the project is to create a programming language that has entirely clear, easy to
understand syntax in English. Flexibility, clarity, and simplicity are musts for the language
(yet to be achieved in any sense of the words). 

This is somewhat achieved through the lexer and parser along with a (right 
now very dumb, barely NLP) NLP algorithm. The language right now has somewhat flexible 
English syntax (take a look at the parser --- in ANTLR). 

The language chokes up extremely with classes and objects right now. Any nesting of 
'code blocks' or sentences also cause extremely slow run times.
